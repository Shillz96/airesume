Alternative: Match HomePage to SubscriptionPage
If you prefer the larger spacing of the "Subscription Management" page (default p margin of ~16px), you can remove the mt-1 class from HomePage (if present) and let the default p margin apply. However, the tighter spacing (mt-1) is generally more visually appealing for a header section, as it creates a more cohesive look, which is likely why it was used in the "Job Finder" page.
7. Additional Considerations
Global Styles: Check your global CSS for any styles that might affect p margins. For example, if you have a global reset like this:
css
p {
  margin: 0;
}

Then the default p margin would be removed, and you’d need to explicitly set mt- classes everywhere. Based on the images, this doesn’t seem to be the case, as the default p margin is visible in SubscriptionPage.
Line Height: The line-height of the h1 and p tags can affect perceived spacing. Both pages use text-3xl for the h1 (font-size: 30px) and text-muted-foreground for the p (likely a smaller font size, e.g., 16px). If cosmic-text-gradient in HomePage adjusts the line-height, it could contribute to the spacing difference. You can normalize this by setting a consistent line-height:
css
h1 {
  line-height: 1.2;
}
p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}

Consistency Across Pages: To ensure consistent spacing across all pages, consider defining a reusable PageHeader component:
jsx
const PageHeader = ({ title, subtitle }) => (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-6">
    <div>
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">{title}</h1>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-1">{subtitle}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
);

// In SubscriptionPage
<PageHeader
  title="Subscription Management"
  subtitle="Manage your plans, add-ons, and payment history"
/>

// In HomePage
<PageHeader
  title={
    <>
      Welcome back, <span className="cosmic-text-gradient">{user?.username}</span>!
    </>
  }
  subtitle="Navigate your career journey with AI-powered tools and insights."
/>

This ensures consistent spacing and styling for all page headers.
