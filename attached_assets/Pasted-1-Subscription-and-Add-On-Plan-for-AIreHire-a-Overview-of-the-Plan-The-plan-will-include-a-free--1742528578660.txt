2. Payment Integration: Stripe and Cryptocurrency Options
a. Overview of Payment Systems
Stripe: A widely used payment processor for traditional payments (credit/debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay). It’s reliable, secure, and easy to integrate.
Cryptocurrency: Adding crypto payments appeals to tech-savvy users and aligns with your AI-driven brand. We’ll use a crypto payment gateway that integrates with Stripe or operates alongside it.
b. Setting Up Stripe for Traditional Payments
Stripe will handle your primary payment methods (credit/debit cards, etc.) for subscriptions and add-ons.
Steps to Integrate Stripe:
Sign Up for Stripe:
Create a Stripe account at stripe.com (free to set up, 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction fee).
Verify your business details and connect your bank account for payouts.
Integrate Stripe with Your Website:
Use Stripe’s pre-built Checkout or Elements for a seamless payment experience.
If you’re using a platform like WordPress, install a plugin like WooCommerce with the Stripe extension (free).
For a custom site, use Stripe’s API. Here’s a basic example using Stripe’s JavaScript library:
html
<!-- Add Stripe.js -->
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>

<!-- Payment Form -->
<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="card-element"></div>
  <button id="submit">Pay Now</button>
  <div id="error-message"></div>
</form>

<script>
  const stripe = Stripe('your-publishable-key-here');
  const elements = stripe.elements();
  const cardElement = elements.create('card');
  cardElement.mount('#card-element');

  const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');
  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const { paymentIntent, error } = await stripe.confirmCardPayment('your-client-secret-here', {
      payment_method: { card: cardElement },
    });
    if (error) {
      document.getElementById('error-message').textContent = error.message;
    } else {
      alert('Payment successful!');
      // Redirect to success page
    }
  });
</script>
Replace 'your-publishable-key-here' and 'your-client-secret-here' with your Stripe keys (found in your Stripe dashboard).
Set Up Subscriptions:
Use Stripe’s Subscriptions API to manage recurring payments for the Starter, Pro, and Career Builder plans.
Example (backend with Node.js):
javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')('your-secret-key-here');

async function createSubscription(customerId, planId) {
  const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
    customer: customerId,
    items: [{ price: planId }], // e.g., price_123 for $5/month Starter Plan
  });
  return subscription;
}
Create prices in your Stripe dashboard (e.g., $5/month for Starter, $10/month for Pro) and map them to your plans.
Handle Add-Ons:
Use Stripe’s one-time payments for add-ons like the Cover Letter Pack or Interview Session.
Example: Create a product in Stripe for “Cover Letter Pack” ($3), then charge users via the Checkout API.
Test and Launch:
Test payments in Stripe’s test mode (use test card numbers like 4242 4242 4242 4242).
Once tested, switch to live mode and start accepting payments.
Cost: Free to set up, 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (e.g., $0.45 fee on a $5 payment).
c. Adding Cryptocurrency Payments
Crypto payments will be an alternative option for users, integrated alongside Stripe. We’ll use a crypto payment gateway that supports popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins like USDT or USDC.
Steps to Integrate Crypto Payments:
Choose a Crypto Payment Gateway:
Coinbase Commerce: Free to set up, supports BTC, ETH, USDT, and more (1% transaction fee).
BitPay: Another option, supports BTC and others (1% fee).
For this plan, we’ll use Coinbase Commerce due to its simplicity and integration options.
Sign Up for Coinbase Commerce:
Create an account at commerce.coinbase.com.
Verify your business details and connect a crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet) to receive payments.
Integrate Coinbase Commerce with Your Website:
Generate an API key in Coinbase Commerce and add it to your site.
Use Coinbase Commerce’s hosted checkout or API to create payment buttons.
Example (Node.js backend to create a crypto payment):
javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function createCryptoCharge(amount, currency, description) {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.commerce.coinbase.com/charges', {
    name: 'AIreHire Subscription',
    description: description, // e.g., "Starter Plan - 1 Month"
    local_price: { amount: amount, currency: currency }, // e.g., 5.00 USD
    pricing_type: 'fixed_price',
  }, {
    headers: { 'X-CC-Api-Key': 'your-api-key-here', 'X-CC-Version': '2018-03-22' },
  });
  return response.data.data;
}

// Call this when a user selects crypto payment
app.post('/create-crypto-charge', async (req, res) => {
  const charge = await createCryptoCharge(5.00, 'USD', 'Starter Plan - 1 Month');
  res.json({ hosted_url: charge.hosted_url }); // Redirect user to this URL to pay
});
On the frontend, redirect the user to the hosted_url to complete the crypto payment.
Add Crypto as a Payment Option:
On your checkout page, add a toggle or button: “Pay with Card (Stripe)” or “Pay with Crypto (Coinbase Commerce).”
Example HTML:
html
<div>
  <button onclick="payWithStripe()">Pay with Card</button>
  <button onclick="payWithCrypto()">Pay with Crypto</button>
</div>
<script>
  async function payWithCrypto() {
    const response = await fetch('/create-crypto-charge', { method: 'POST' });
    const data = await response.json();
    window.location.href = data.hosted_url; // Redirect to Coinbase Commerce checkout
  }
  function payWithStripe() {
    // Handle Stripe payment (as shown earlier)
  }
</script>
Handle Crypto Payments:
Coinbase Commerce will notify you via webhook when a payment is confirmed.
Set up a webhook endpoint on your server to update the user’s account (e.g., activate their subscription) once payment is received.
Example (Node.js webhook handler):
javascript
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body;
  if (event.event.type === 'charge:confirmed') {
    const userId = event.event.data.metadata.user_id; // Pass user_id in metadata when creating charge
    // Update user subscription in your database
    console.log(`Payment confirmed for user ${userId}`);
  }
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
Test and Launch:
Test crypto payments in Coinbase Commerce’s sandbox mode.
Once tested, go live and offer crypto as a payment option.
Cost: Free to set up, 1% transaction fee (e.g., $0.05 fee on a $5 payment).
Supported Cryptos: Offer Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT, and USDC to cover popular options. Stablecoins like USDT/USDC are preferred by users to avoid price volatility.
d. Why This Payment Setup Works
Stripe: Handles 90%+ of your transactions with a trusted, user-friendly experience for credit/debit cards. It’s ideal for most job seekers and supports recurring payments for subscriptions.
Crypto: Appeals to tech-savvy users (e.g., developers, blockchain enthusiasts) who prefer crypto payments. It also aligns with your AI-driven brand, adding a futuristic vibe.
Combined Approach: Offering both options ensures you don’t lose users due to payment preferences. Stripe and Coinbase Commerce are both developer-friendly and widely used.

3. Implementation Tips
User Experience:
Clearly label payment options at checkout (e.g., “Pay with Card” and “Pay with Crypto”).
For crypto payments, provide a brief explainer (e.g., “Pay with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT – Secure and Fast!”) to reassure users.
After payment, redirect users to a confirmation page (e.g., “Thank You! Your Pro Plan is Active.”).
Security:
Use HTTPS on your site to secure payment data.
For Stripe, enable 3D Secure to reduce fraud.
For Coinbase Commerce, verify webhook signatures to ensure payment notifications are legitimate.
Currency Conversion for Crypto:
Coinbase Commerce automatically converts crypto payments to USD (or your preferred currency) before depositing them into your wallet, so you don’t need to handle conversions manually.
Promotion:
Highlight crypto payments as a feature in your marketing (e.g., “Pay with Crypto on AIreHire – Join the Future of Job Hunting!”). This can attract crypto enthusiasts and differentiate your platform.
