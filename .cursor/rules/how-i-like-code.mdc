#coding workflow preferences 

-Focus on the areas of the code relevent to the task
-Do not touch the code that is unrelated to the task
- Write through tests for all major fnctionality
- Avoid major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has show to work well unless explicitly instructed
-Awlays think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
